### 复合赋值和迭代语句
#### - 通过复合赋值操作 来 更新一个变量值 update the value of a variable by using compound assignment operators
#### - 迭代声明 write _while_, _for_, & _do_ iteration statements
#### - step through a _do_ statement and watch as the value of variable change

|DON'T|DO|
|-----|--|
|variable = variable * number;|variable *= number;|
|variable = variable / number;|variable /= number;|
|variable = variable % number;|variable %= number;|
|variable = variable + number;|variable += number;|
|variable = variable - number;|variable -= number;|

#### 复合赋值操作共享相同的 优先权和 右结合律 和 简单的赋值操作符 相同（"="）
#### The compound assignment operators share the same precedence and right associativity as the simple assignment operator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The += operator also works on strings; it appends one string to the end of another. For example, the following code displays "Hello John" on the console:
```
string name = "John";
string greeting = "Hello";
greeting += name;
Console.WriteLine(greeting);
```

use the increment(++) and decrement (--) operators instead of a compound assignment operator when incrementing of decrementing a variable by 1. For example, replace

```
count += 1;
```
with
```
count ++
```

#### Writing _while_ statements 
use _while_ statement to run a statement repeatedly for as long as some condition is true. The syntax of a _while_ statement is as follows:
```
while (booleanExpression)
  statement
```

- The expression must be a Boolean expression. 表达式必须是布尔表达式
- The Boolean expression must be written within parentheses. 布尔表达式必须写在括弧中
- if the Boolean expression evaluates to false when first evaluated, the statement does not run. 布尔表达式评估为假，陈述就不运行
- if you want to perform two or more statement under the control of a _while_ statement, you must use braces to group those statements in a block.  如果要在_while_声明下运行 两个或更多的 陈述，需要使用括弧把 陈述包成块

a _while_ statement that writes the value 0 through 9 to the console. Note that as soon as the variable _i_ reaches the value 10, the _while_ statement finishes and code in the statement block does not run:
```
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
  i++;
}
```
The variable _i_ in the _while_ loop controls the number of iterations that the loop performs. This is a common idiom,也就是我们常说的熟语也称之为习语 and the variable that performs this role is sometimes called the _sentinel_ variable. 履行这个职责的变量称之为 哨兵变量。 还能创建nested loops(one loop inside another), and in these case it is common to extend this naming pattern to use the letters _j_, _k_ and even _l_ as the name of the sentinel variable used to control the iterations in these loops.

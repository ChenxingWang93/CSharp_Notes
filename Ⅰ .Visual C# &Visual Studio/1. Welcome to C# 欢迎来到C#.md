#### - **Solution 'TestHello'** 
###### is the top - level solution file. Each application contains a single solution file. A solution can contain one or more project   //应用包含一个 单一的 solution 📃，一个 solution 包含 一个或多个 project 

#### - **TestHello** C# project file. 
###### Each project file references one or more file containing the source code and other artifacts for the project, such as graphics images. You must write all the source code in a single project in the same programming language. In File Explorer. this file is actually called TestHello.csproj, and it is stored in the \Microsoft Press\VCSBS\Chapter 1\TestHello folder in your Documents folder  //每一个project 文件 参考 一个或者更多📃 包含源代码以及其他项目物件，例如图像。必须要在单一的项目用同一个编码语言 书写所有源代码。在 文件探索 中，文件实际上是叫做 TestHello.csproj 保存在\Microsoft Press\VCSBS\Chapter 1\TestHello 文件夹中

#### - **Properties**
###### This is a folder in the TestHello project. If you expand it(click the arrow next to Properties), you will see that it contains a file called _AssemblyInfo.cs_. _AssemblyInfo.cs_ is a special file that you can use to add attributes to a program, such as the name of the author, the data the program was written, and so on. You can specify additional attributes to modify the way in which the program runs. Explaining how to use these attributes is beyond the scope of this book.  //_AssemblyInfo.cs_ 是 一个特殊的文件 使用添加 属性 到程序中，例如 作者，日期

#### - **App.config** 
###### you can specify settings that your application uses at run time to modify its behaviour，such as the version of the .NET Framework to run the application //应用程序的配置文件, 并不总会被展示。

#### - **Program.cs**
###### This is a C# source file, and it is displayed in the Code and Text Editor window when the project is first created. You will write your code for the console application in this file. It also contains some code that Visual Studio provides automatically, which you will examine shortly.

#### - Using namespaces 命名空间
###### The example you have seen so far is a very small program. However, small programs can grow into much bigger programs. As a program grows, two issues arise. First, it is harder to understand and maintain big programs than it is to understand and maintain smaller one. Second, more code usually means more classes, with more methods, requiring you to keep track of more names. As the number of names increases, so does likehood of the project build failing bc two or more names clash; you may try to create two classes with the same name. The situation become more complicated when a program references assemblies written by other developers who have also used a variety of names.
###### In the past, programmers tried to solve the name-clashing problem by prefixing names with some sort of qualifier (or set of qualifiers). this is not a good solution because it's not scalable; names become longer, and you spend less time writing software and more time typing(there is a difference), and reading and rereading incomprehensibly long names.

###### Namespaces help solve this problem by creating a container for items such as classes. Two classes with the same name will not be confused with each other if they live in different namespaces. You can create a class named _Greeting_ inside the namespace name _TestHello_ by using the _namespace_ keyword like this:
```C#
namespace TestHello
{
  class Greeting 
  {
    ...
  }
}
```

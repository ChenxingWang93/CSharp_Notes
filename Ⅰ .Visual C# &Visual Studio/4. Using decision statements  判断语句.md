### Using _switch_ statements
### Understanding _switch_ statements syntax
The syntax of a _switch_ statement is as follows(_switch, case, and default_ are keywords):
``` C#
switch ( controllingExpression )
{
  case constantExpression :
    statements
    break;
  case constantExpression :
    statements
    break;
  ...
  default :
    statements
    break;
}
```

the _controllingExpression_, is evaluated once.
(The _constantExpression_ identifier is also called a _caselabel_) Execution runs as far as the _break_ statement. If none of the _constantExpression_ values is equal to the value of the _controllingExpression_ ,the statements below the optional _default label_ run.
